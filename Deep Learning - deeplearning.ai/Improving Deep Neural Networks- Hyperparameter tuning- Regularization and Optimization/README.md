# Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

## Week 1

### Setting up your Machine Learning Application

- Train/ Dev/ Test sets
- Bias/ Variance
- Basic recipe for Machine Learning

### Regularizing your Neural Network

- Regularization
- Why regularization reduces overfitting?
  - A higher value of λ forces the ω to have values ≈ 0. The equation of NN simplifies as some of the nodes become less active due to lower values of ω. Thus the neural netowrk approaches the "High bias" state from "High variance" state
